Once a player creates or joins a room, they can choose their mover and click ready. Once all players are ready, the host can start the game

Once a game is started, each player clicks the button to roll the dice to determine turn order. Afterwards, players traverse through a board that is hidden to buy properties, collect cards, and increase their money until a player has reached $1,000,000.
